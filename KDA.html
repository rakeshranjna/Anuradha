        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I love K/DA, my prime source of inspiration and reason for me to get into music and music/audio technology, production and composition first-hand, all three of art, hardware and software.
        </p>
        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <p>
            I have dreams of building a DAW and later get into audio hardware development and advancement. At the moment, I am working on creating audio plug-ins of a unique, innovative sort.
        </p>
        <h2>Here is a list of what I am working on and what platforms I am using:</h2>
        <p>
            1) Working on a audio plug-in that serves the basic functions namely of volume control, filtering, compression and reverb all in one package.
            2) Doing audio signal processing research on MATLAB in the quest for discovering new audio effects that can be converted into plug-ins.
            Currently, that is all. Will update as more progress is achieved and new aims are added to the line.
